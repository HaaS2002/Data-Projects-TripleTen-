Analysis of the Vacation Rental Market in Manhattan - I analyzed Airbnb data for Manhattan to guide a clientâ€™s investment in vacation rentals. The project involved data cleaning, identifying popular neighborhoods and property types, calculating occupancy rates, and estimating annual revenue for potential investments. I provided actionable insights to help prioritize property selection and optimize rental income.
